                <h2>The History of the Guitar</h2>
                <p>
                    The Guitar comes from the classical instrument called the lyre used in classical antiquity, invented by the Hittites around 1500 BC. 
                    And the Greek poets used it to accompany their verses with this instrument. On some occasions, they used picks to play it, the same way with guitars.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most significant development towards designing the modern-day guitar came in the 16th century. Guitars were split into two varieties - the lute, a rounded medieval instrument that produced little volume, 
                    and the vihuela, whose design looked much closer to the one we know today. The shape had something of a waist to it and the strings were designed to be strummed, rather than plucked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the 19th century, the guitar was adapted for the plucking and strumming technique, becoming a concert instrument. It also arrived in the United States, introducing changes to its structure and the flamenco guitar emerged.
                    At the turn of the 20th century, it became one of the most important and most used instruments globally because it adapts to any environment and is very easy to use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The history of the electric guitar begins in the middle of the 20th century in the United States. The electric guitar is created out of the need of the jazz bands of the United States in the 1920s 
                    because the acoustic guitars emitted little sound, which made the instrument of no importance.
                <p>
                    The creation of the electric guitar originated new musical styles such as Heavy Metal and Rock. It was quickly adopted by Blues and Jazz groups, making it the symbol of these new musical genres.

                <h3>Classical Guitar</h3>
                <p>
                    The most defining characteristic of the classical guitar is the nylon strings instead of steel strings. This allows the guitar to produce a soft, pleasant sound. This sound is more suitable for classical music.
                </p>

                <h3>Acoustic Guitar</h3>
                <p>
                    A key characteristic of the acoustic guitar is the steel strings. These strings are not only stronger than nylon strings, but they also produce a much louder yet mellow sound. An acoustic guitar is well-suited for music genres, ranging from rock to jazz.

            <h3>Electric Guitar</h3>
            <p>
                An electric guitar is a guitar that produces sound by vibrating strings over a pickup that converts the vibrations into electrical signals. Those signals are fed into an amplifier, which projects the musical performance at a wide range of volumes. 
                <br/>
                Electric guitar's strings are mainly made from stainless steel. Stainless steel strings tend to be brighter and snappier than other types of strings which makes them very suitable for rock and metal music.

                        The body of the guitar is the main wooden part. It provides the resonance that shapes the tone of an acoustic or electric guitar.

                    <li>
                        A sound hole (also known as a sound chamber) is a hollow chamber found on all acoustic guitars. They will always be located in a specific place invariably found under the strings on the body of a guitar. 
                        This is the same location where pickups are found on electric guitars. You can consider the sound hole as a resonating chamber that is a substitute for pickups. The vibrational waves are formed within the body of the guitar. This in turn produces an amplified sound.

                        The strings of the guitar are named for the notes produced by open strings. An open string is one where you are not pressing down on any fret.

                        <li> The 2nd guitar string produces a <span>B</span> note.</li>
                        <li>The 3rd guitar string produces a <span>G</span> note.</li>

                    <li>Many electric tuners come with a built in microphone for use with an acoustic gui- tar. If you are using an electric guitar you can plug your instrument cable directly into the tuner. 
                        According to the directions of your specific tuner, it will display whether you need to tighten or loosen the string in order to be in tune. Electric tuners are an easy to use, fast, and accurate way to tune your guitar.

                <p>You can also tune your guitar by listening carefully to the other strings and tuning each string to the others. Here is the process.</p>
                <ul style="margin-right: 10%;">
                   <li>Put your finger on the fifth fret of the sixth string. Now, play the sixth string and the open fifth string. Listen to the two pitches. If the open fifth string sounds lower than the sixth string then tighten the fifth string tuning key until the two notes match. If the open fifth string sounds higher than the first note then loosen the fifth string tuning key. You always adjust the tuning keys of the open string, not the string that you are fretting.</li>
                    <li>Next, play the fifth fret on the fifth string and the open fourth string underneath it. Listen to the two pitches care- fully and adjust the open fourth string accordingly.</li>
                    <li>Play the fourth string at the fifth fret. Listen and tune the open third string to it.</li>
                    <li>To tune the second string, play the third string at the fourth fret and tune the open second string to it. This is the only string that does not use the fifth fret as the reference.</li>
                    <li>Lastly, play the second string fingered back at the fifth fret and tune the open first string to it.</li>
